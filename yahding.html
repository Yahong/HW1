Hello world!
Yahong Ding
I think the github system is very interesting even though it will take me a long time to finish it.
This class is fun and I am looking forward to learning more deep knowledge of this class. 
The professor talks a bit fast so that I cannot catch him during the whole class. I just realized that there is lots of information that I should know.
